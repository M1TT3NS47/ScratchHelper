    <p>Scratch helper is a website which will help you with coding with 
      Scratch.30 (sb3). This contains blocks and how the blocks work for 
      you to understand easily.

      This is the change x block. If you have studied coordinate planes, then you know what the x coordinate is. If you don't, then let me teach you. The x coordinate
      is just the left and right position of a point or object. This block would change the x by how much numbers is inside of the circle. The Circle is a input variable
      which can have any variable inside of it. Positive numbers mean right, and negative numbers mean left.

      This is the change y block. If you have studied coordinate planes, then you know what the y coordinate is. If you don't, then let me teach you. The x coordinate
      is just the up and down position of a point or object. This block would change the y by how much numbers is inside of the circle. The Circle is a input variable
      which can have any variable inside of it. Positive numbers mean up, and negative numbers mean down.
